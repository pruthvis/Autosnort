#Functions, functions everywhere.

# Logging setup. Ganked this entirely from stack overflow. Uses named pipe magic to log all the output of the script to a file. Also capable of accepting redirects/appends to the file for logging compiler stuff (configure, make and make install) to a log file instead of losing it on a screen buffer. This gives the user cleaner output, while logging everything in the background, in the event they need to send it to me for analysis/assistance.
